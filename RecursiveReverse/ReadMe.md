# RecursiveReverse()
### Language
C/C++
## Description
(This problem is difficult and is only possible if you are familiar with recursion.) There is
a short and efficient recursive solution to this problem. As before, the code should only
make a single pass over the list. Doing it with multiple passes is easier but very slow, so
here we insist on doing it in one pass.. Solving this problem requires a real understanding
of pointer code and recursion.

/*
Recursively reverses the given linked list by changing its .next
pointers and its head pointer in one pass of the list.
*/

void RecursiveReverse(struct node** headRef) {
// your code...

Challenge here is to perform the recursive reverse with only a single argument
